# How do contribute to open source like a pro.

This is a test repository that will be used to show how to setup and manage a Github repository to manage an open source project.

A good README.md, will be able to answer the following questions:
* What is this project looking to achieve? 
* What is the vision and what are the problems you are looking to address
* What does this project do?
* Why is this project useful?
* How do I get started?
* Where can I get more help, if I need it?

## Project Governance

You should add the following in your project to clearly communicate how contributions will impact this project. Transparancy is key and contributors should have a clear path from initial users, contributors to committers and technical design leads for a project.

Document the following:

* Set expectations of how you will manage this project and document the kinds of things you would want to know if you were about to contribute to a project. What types of contributions are you looking for, the process for accepting them, how long it will take for the process to work and how to escalate.
* Make sure you think about how you will identify and celebrate your contributors and contributions. Do you want to have a page or maybe you can share via social media.
* What tools will you be using and what channels you will use to collaborate - IIRC, Slack, mailing lists for example.

### Make sure you:
Keep all documentation and decision making in the open to increase transparancy. Avoid 'hallway decisions'
Add these within your README.md file or create separate files in your project repository
Add a CHANGELOG.md file to track changes, updates and releases. This will also help if you decide to use certain licenses that require this.
