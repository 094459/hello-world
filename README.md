![aws logo aws contribute, aws code, aws open source](./images/awsisopen.jpeg "AWS Open Source")

This is a test repository that will be used to show how to setup and manage a Github repository to manage an open source project.

## Layout

Make sure you have the following sections and details in your readme file, and link to files to make it easier for people coming to your repository to click on the supporting info.

1. Overview of Project
2. How to contribute
3. Project governance
4. Code of Conduct
5. License

## Overview of project

A good README.md, will be able to answer the following questions:

* What is this project looking to achieve ?
* What is the vision and what are the problems you are looking to address
* What does this project do?
* Why is this project useful?
* How do I get started?
* Where can I get more help, if I need it?

## How to contribute

See the (./CONTRIBUTING.md) file

## Project Governance

You should add the following in your project to clearly communicate how contributions will impact this project. Transparancy is key and contributors should have a clear path from initial users, contributors to committers and technical design leads for a project.

Document the following:

* Set expectations of how you will manage this project and document the kinds of things you would want to know if you were about to contribute to a project. What types of contributions are you looking for, the process for accepting them, how long it will take for the process to work and how to escalate.
* Make sure you think about how you will identify and celebrate your contributors and contributions. Do you want to have a page or maybe you can share via social media.
* What tools will you be using and what channels you will use to collaborate - IIRC, Slack, mailing lists for example.

## Code of Conduct

Make sure you add a [code of conduct file](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## License

If you do not add a license file it is not open source and no one will use this project. Think about what you want to achieve with this project and how different licenses will attract and help you build that community.

### Make sure you

* Keep all documentation and decision making in the open to increase transparancy. Avoid 'hallway decisions'
* Add these within your README.md file or create separate files in your project repository
* Add a [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file to track changes, updates and releases. This will also help if you decide to use certain licenses that require this.
