### Code of conduct

Make sure you think about and then include a code of conduct for your project. One common pattern if you have lots of projects is to create a dedicted code of conduct project and then for each new project, create a CODE_OF_CODUCT.md file that links to that project. This way once you update it centrally, it is reflected in all your projects.

If you are struggling on what to put into this, either search your favourite projects or you can use guidelines such as this one https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/ to help you. A good code of conduct should look something like this -> https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct

Make sure you link to this from your project README.md
