# Contributing

## Helping people know what they have to do

You should make the process of how you want people to contribute to your projects crystal clear. This should include;

* A getting started section - what tools do you need to start developing with this project, sample scripts to build, test and run the projet and anything else that you need to get up and running. Approach this with the assumption of "if I was seeing this project for the first time, these instructions would allow me to get the code, build, test and deploy it. Make sure you also add tecnical pre-req's to make it super easy for people to know what they need.
* Outline the Pull Request process in detail - go through the steps you want them to follow. For example, opening/filing an issue, design work, coding, committing, pull requests and merging
* Tools - go into detail the tools and supporting scripts the project uses. Update this as your project grows.
* Workflows - add common workflows that will be useful for people getting started. Running a clean build, deploying on different targets, partial/full builds, adding dependencies
* Troubleshooting - add what to do if people get stuck together with a sample KNOWN ISSUES section to help auto solve those common issues (that might have been documented through logged ISSUES)
* Prior Art - you might find it useful to link to other projects that are either direclty similar to your project or have influenced your project
* Related Repos - add additional projects you either need or related in some way to this project (and dont forget to detail the relationship)

Make sure you link to this from your project README.me file

## Templates

Create a .github folder in your project, and then add a PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file which will be used every time a PR is requested. This can help you enforce your contribution expections, link to CLA agreements or get confirmation around licensing of the code being committed.

Please refer to <https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/> for further best practice and guidance.
